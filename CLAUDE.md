# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Running

```bash
python3 news_curator.py
```

No dependencies beyond the Python 3.10+ standard library. Requires the `claude` CLI (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) to be available on PATH for the LLM curation step.

## Architecture

Single-script application (`news_curator.py`) that runs as a daily batch job:

1. **Fetch** — Downloads RSS/Atom feeds defined in `config.json` via `urllib`
2. **Dedup** — Filters out previously seen articles using SQLite (`seen.db`)
3. **Date Filter** — Drops articles older than `max_age_days` (default 3); articles with unparseable dates are kept
4. **Curate** — Sends all new articles to Claude CLI (`claude -p`) in a single prompt; Claude returns a JSON array of scored/summarized selections
5. **Publish** — Creates a Notion database page with the curated digest via the Notion API

The Claude CLI is invoked as a subprocess with `--output-format text --max-turns 4`. The `CLAUDECODE` env var is explicitly stripped to avoid recursion. The prompt and all curation output are in Korean.

Notion output lists articles sorted by score (highest first) without exposing scores or tier labels to readers. Scores are used internally for filtering (`min_score`) and ordering only. When no articles pass curation, a "쉬어가기" rest-day message is shown. Blocks are batched in groups of 100 per Notion API limits.

## Key Files

- `news_curator.py` — Entire application logic (feed parsing, Claude CLI integration, Notion page builder)
- `config.json` — Feed URLs, curator persona/interests, Notion API credentials, scoring thresholds (gitignored)
- `config.example.json` — Template config with placeholder values
- `seen.db` — SQLite database for article deduplication (auto-created, auto-pruned after `retention_days`)
- `curator.log` — Runtime log file

## Config Structure (`config.json`)

- `feeds[]` — RSS/Atom sources with `name`, `url`, optional `headers`
- `curator` — LLM settings: `model`, `persona`, `interests[]`, `max_articles`
- `notion` — Notion API config: `token`, `database_id`
- `scoring` — `min_score` (1-10 threshold), `max_articles_per_source`, `max_age_days`
- `db` — `retention_days` for SQLite cleanup

## Important Notes

- Feed parsing handles both RSS 2.0 (`<item>`) and Atom (`<entry>`) formats with `xml.etree.ElementTree`
- Claude's JSON response is parsed with fallback regex extraction if markdown code fences are present
- ALL fetched articles (not just curated ones) are marked as seen in SQLite to prevent re-processing
- Notion page properties use Korean field names: `이름` (title), `작성일` (date)
